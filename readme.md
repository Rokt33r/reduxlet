# Reduxlet

A small container component with an isolated Redux store.

## Intro

**Manage state of a component just like redux!**

Reduxlet create a redux store, which is context-free, for a single container component.
Let's use `actions` and `reducer` instead of using `this.setState`!

Also, lots of sugar is inside by default. Binding actions to dispatch, composing enhancers and applying middleware become much easier!
